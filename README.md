# Franz Recipes

These are development recipes I use in Franz.

To use, simply:
- Clone, copy or symlink this repo to ~/Library/Application Support/Franz/recipes/dev/
- _View->Reload Franz_
- Add a new service via _Services->Add New Service ..._
- Select the Development tab
- Select the Service to add
- Click on Save service

Enjoy !!

**Note**: to have a service go back to their home page, simply right click on the service in the left pane and click on Reload.
